# dl-ada
Minimal binding to libdl

# Notes
The high-level binding relies on an autogenerated low-level one. The one already included is for a 64bits Linux. You may regenerate it with `regen.sh`.

This project depends on the cstrings one. You can pull it as a git submodule, and compile with dl_build.gpr, or set up your environment with Alire.
